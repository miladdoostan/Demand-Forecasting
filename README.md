# Demand-Forecasting

This is a code written by me to the Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge in Kaggle. In this competition, the participants are given 5 years of store-item sales data and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores. I carried out a comprehensive outlier detection and handling process, feature engineering, and finally the development of an XGB model.
